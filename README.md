## To-Do
- [ ] https://github.com/12th-devs/Advanced-Tab-Groups/issues/111
- [x] Add Arc & Edge Styles
- [x] Allow folder to group conversion (@JustaDumbPrsn) Thank you Bibek!
- [ ] Fix odd scrolling glitches
- [x] Add the font fade overflow effect
- [x] Fix renaming glitches
- [x] Add icon support
- [x] Improve animations
- [ ] Add the stashing feature (soonâ„¢)

These are in no specific order and just an idea of what is coming for the `v3.x.x` release line. I may also add star features because I wanna overtake Nebula
