## ⚠️
* If you are on windows and not on twilight (Firefox 135) then you will have to double click the folders due to a non css bug.

* IF you are not on twilight PLEASE do not try and add a pin tab to a folder! 🙏

* Any issues you encounter please create a ticket on the GitHub page and I will do what I can to help you quickly.

### 2. **Border Around Tab Groups**  
Add a subtle border to enhance the visual separation of tab groups (requires background to be enabled).
